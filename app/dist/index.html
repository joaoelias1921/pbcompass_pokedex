                    <p> Pokémon — short for pocket monsters — is the name of a game (really several) involving creatures called “pokémon” and 
                        “trainers”. <br></br>Within the narrative of the game, the pokémon trainer catches pokémon in little holding containers 
                        (called “pokeballs”), and then uses those pokémon to fight other pokémon. On its surface, the fights have two reasons: 
                        <br>1) to weaken and capture wild pokémon; <br>2) to defeat other pokémon trainers. <br></br>The pokémon themselves are various, 
                        having different appearances, names, powers, potentials, weaknesses, and personalities. <br>The actual form of the game, 
                        again, on its surface, takes several forms, having it's own card game, Gameboy versions, a Nintendo 64 version,
                        many cartoons and movies, various toys, merchandise and artifacts.</p>

                    <h1>History</h1>
                    <p> The franchise has its roots in a gaming magazine in the early 1980s in Japan—Game Freak, started by Satoshi Tajiri 
                        and Ken Sugimori. Tajiri was the writer, while Sugimori was the illustrator. They soon realized that the arcade scene at 
                        the time wasn’t too hot anymore and decided to develop games themselves. This included games that were published by Nintendo 
                        on the NES and Game Boy like Yoshi and even games for SEGA like Magical Tarurūto-kun on the Mega Drive, SEGA’s console. 
                        In its time as a developer, Game Freak had its titles published by the likes of even Sony back then. <br></br>When Tajiri and 
                        Co. put forth the idea of Pokémon to Nintendo, though, the publishers didn’t really get it. However, Tajiri was given
                        the benefit of doubt thanks to the success of Game Freak’s previous titles, and he worked under the mentorship of Shigeru 
                        Miyamoto to create Pocket Monsters: Red and Green, a game that combined the collecting and trading of monsters. And 
                        thus began a franchise that went on to become the second largest gaming franchise ever. (In case you are wondering, Mario 
                        is the largest, and it also happens to be owned by Nintendo.) <br></br>26 February 1996 marks the debut of the Pokémon 
                        franchise in the form of both those games on the Game Boy in Japan. At its heart, Pocket Monsters: Red and Green was a 
                        very basic Japanese role-playing game. You play as a Pokémon trainer travelling the world and collecting the ubiquitous
                        little monsters (inspired by Tajiri’s childhood love for insect collection) and training them in battles with other Pokémon.</p>
